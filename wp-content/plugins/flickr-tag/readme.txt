Stable tag: trunk

Insert Flickr sets, tags, photostreams, group pools or individual photos into your posts using a special Wordpress tag.

== Description ==

When I started using WordPress for my blog, I had a hard time finding a [Flickr][] plugin that didn't download all the photos onto my 
server, have them appear in a separate gallery out of context from my post, or otherwise look totally horrible. I just wanted something simple. 
Keep the photos themselves and discussion on Flickr, as far as I'm concerned. I couldn't find anybody to share my design goals, and Flickr Tag was 
born.

== Installation ==

This plugin mostly follows the [standard WordPress installation method][]:

1. Uncompress the downloaded archive in [WordPress install root]/wp-content/plugins.

1. Make sure the cache directory ([WordPress install root]/wp-content/plugins/flickr-tag/cache) is writable by the webserver. 

1. Activate the plugin in your WordPress plugins control panel.

1. Go to the "Plugins" admin page, then choose "Flickr Tag" to configure the plugin. 

After installation and configuration, you'll have a new "Flickr" media icon that appears when you edit/write posts. Use it to insert a favorite, or a set. 
Or, use the "flickr" tag (syntax outlined in the popup media window).

== Screenshots ==

1. The plugin is easily configured through the admin panel. Be sure to visit this admin page upon initial installation to authenticate to Flickr.
2. A new "Flickr" media button is available when writing blog entries. It provides an easy way to insert a set or recent photo from your photostream (or a set).
3. An example of use. The plugin allows photos to be linked to Flickr, showing the description of the photo in a tooltip (as shown above), or the plugin can be configured to show a larger version of the photo in a [Lightbox][].
